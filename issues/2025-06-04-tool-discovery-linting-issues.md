# Linting and Code Quality Issues in Tool Discovery Implementation

**Date**: 2025-06-04  
**Status**: Open

## Description

During the implementation of Stage 3 (Tool Discovery), several linting issues were identified that should be addressed to improve code quality and maintainability.

## Issues

### 1. Exception Handling Best Practices

- Many exception handlers in the file_routes.py file are missing proper exception chaining with `from` clause.
- Example warning: "Within an `except` clause, raise exceptions with `raise ... from err` or `raise ... from None` to distinguish them from errors in exception handling"

### 2. Whitespace and Formatting Issues

- Multiple instances of trailing whitespace in various files
- Inconsistent line breaks and indentation
- Syntax error in file_service.py on line 194 where a colon was at the wrong position

### 3. Type Annotations

- Some functions could benefit from more specific type annotations, especially for complex return types
- Dictionary type annotations could be more specific with key and value types

### 4. Code Organization

- Consider splitting the FileService class into smaller service classes as it's growing quite large
- The discovery module could be further refined into submodules for different responsibilities

## Recommended Actions

1. **Fix Exception Handling**:
   - Update all exception handlers to use proper exception chaining with `from` clause
   - Example: `raise HTTPException(...) from e` instead of `raise HTTPException(...)`

2. **Run Linting Tools**:
   - Run `uv ruff --fix` to automatically fix common issues
   - Run `uv mypy` to check for type annotation issues

3. **Refactor Large Classes**:
   - Consider splitting FileService into FileService, DiscoveryService, and SchemaService
   - Move tool-related functionality to a dedicated ToolService class

4. **Add Tests**:
   - Create unit tests for the discovery module
   - Add integration tests for the tool discovery API endpoints

## Priority

Medium - These issues don't prevent the functionality from working but should be addressed before the final release to ensure code quality and maintainability.

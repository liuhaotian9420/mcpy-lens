### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/v1/services/register        # Register new service
GET  /api/v1/services/                # List all services (with status filter)
GET  /api/v1/services/{id}            # Get service details
POST /api/v1/services/{id}/activate   # Activate service
POST /api/v1/services/{id}/deactivate # Deactivate service
DELETE /api/v1/services/{id}          # Unregister service
GET  /api/v1/services/{id}/health     # Check service health
GET  /api/v1/services/{id}/tools      # Get service tools
GET  /api/v1/services/stats/overview  # Service statistics
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Verification

### Test Results
- âœ… **Service Registry Models**: Data models and serialization working
- âœ… **Service Registry**: Registration, lookup, and persistence working
- âœ… **Health Monitor**: Functional health testing working
- âœ… **Service Manager**: Lifecycle management and integration working
- âœ… **All 4/4 core functionality tests passing**

### Supported Operations
- **Service Registration**: Manual and automatic registration
- **Service Lifecycle**: Activate, deactivate, unregister services
- **Service Discovery**: List, search, and filter services
- **Health Monitoring**: Functional testing with wrapper execution
- **Statistics**: Comprehensive service and health metrics

## ðŸš€ Usage Workflow

### Automatic Registration (Primary Workflow)
1. **Upload Script** â†’ File service processes script
2. **Generate Wrapper** â†’ Wrapper generation creates MCP wrapper
3. **Auto-Register** â†’ Service automatically registered in registry
4. **Auto-Activate** â†’ Service automatically activated (optional)
5. **Health Monitoring** â†’ Background health checks begin

### Manual Registration (Advanced Workflow)
1. **Register Service** â†’ `POST /api/v1/services/register`
2. **Activate Service** â†’ `POST /api/v1/services/{id}/activate`
3. **Monitor Health** â†’ `GET /api/v1/services/{id}/health`
4. **Manage Lifecycle** â†’ Activate/deactivate as needed

### Example Usage
```bash
# List all services
curl http://localhost:8090/api/v1/services/

# Get service details
curl http://localhost:8090/api/v1/services/{service-id}

# Check service health
curl http://localhost:8090/api/v1/services/{service-id}/health

# Activate service
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/api/v1/services/{service-id}/activate

# Get service statistics
curl http://localhost:8090/api/v1/services/stats/overview
```

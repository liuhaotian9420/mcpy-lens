**Integration Test Scenarios:**
```python
# Example integration test structure
class TestServiceCreationWorkflow:
    def test_function_mode_service_creation(self)
    def test_executable_mode_service_creation(self)
    def test_service_update_and_migration(self)
    def test_service_deletion_and_cleanup(self)
    def test_concurrent_service_operations(self)
```

### 8.4 End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Test complete user workflows through web interface
- [ ] Test file upload, configuration, and deployment flow
- [ ] Test service monitoring and management operations
- [ ] Test error handling and recovery scenarios
- [ ] Test performance under load conditions
- [ ] Test security and access control features

**E2E Test Scenarios:**
1. **New User Onboarding**: Upload first script, create service, test tool
2. **Service Management**: Create, update, monitor, and delete services
3. **Multi-user Scenarios**: Concurrent users with different permissions
4. **Failure Recovery**: Service failures, network issues, system restart
5. **Performance Testing**: High load, many concurrent services
6. **Security Testing**: Authentication, authorization, input validation

### 8.5 Performance and Load Testing
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks for key operations
- [ ] Test service creation and destruction performance
- [ ] Test concurrent request handling capacity
- [ ] Test memory usage and resource management
- [ ] Test SSE streaming performance with multiple clients
- [ ] Test system behavior under resource constraints

**Performance Test Metrics:**
- Service creation time (target: <5 seconds)
- Request response time (target: <500ms for simple tools)
- Concurrent user capacity (target: 100+ simultaneous users)
- Memory usage per service (target: <100MB baseline)
- SSE streaming latency (target: <100ms)
- System recovery time after failures (target: <30 seconds)

### 8.6 Mock Services and Test Data
- [ ] Create mock Python scripts for testing various scenarios
- [ ] Generate test data for different service configurations
- [ ] Create mock external dependencies and services
- [ ] Implement test fixtures for consistent test environments
- [ ] Create sample tools covering common use cases
- [ ] Generate edge case test data and scenarios

**Test Script Categories:**
- **Simple Scripts**: Basic functions with minimal dependencies
- **Complex Scripts**: Multiple functions, external imports
- **Error Scripts**: Syntax errors, runtime exceptions
- **Long-running Scripts**: Scripts that produce streaming output
- **Resource-intensive Scripts**: High memory/CPU usage
- **Malicious Scripts**: Security testing scenarios

### 8.7 Error Handling and Edge Case Testing

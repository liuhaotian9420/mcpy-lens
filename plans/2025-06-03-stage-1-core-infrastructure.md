**Date**: 2025-06-03  
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅  
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-03 18:30

## Description

Establish the foundational infrastructure for the mcpy-lens web application, including project setup, core dependencies, and basic FastAPI application with dynamic routing capabilities.

## Tasks

### 1.1 Project Structure Setup
- [x] Initialize virtual environment using `.venv`
- [x] Configure `pyproject.toml` with project dependencies
- [x] Set up basic project structure following project guidelines
- [x] Configure development tools (ruff, mypy, pytest)
- [x] Create basic `requirements.txt` with core dependencies
- [x] **FIXED**: Install package in editable mode to resolve module import issues

**Dependencies needed:**
- `fastapi` - Web framework
- `uvicorn` - ASGI server
- `pydantic` - Data validation
- `python-multipart` - File upload support
- `aiofiles` - Async file operations
- `typer` - CLI wrapper generation
- `watchfiles` - File monitoring for dynamic loading

### 1.2 Basic FastAPI Application
- [x] Create main FastAPI application in `src/mcpy_lens/app.py`
- [x] Implement basic health check endpoint
- [x] Set up CORS middleware for web interface
- [x] Configure logging and error handling
- [x] Add basic request/response models
- [x] **VERIFIED**: Application starts successfully and is accessible

### 1.3 Dynamic Routing Infrastructure
- [x] Implement thread-safe route management system
- [x] Create route registry with locking mechanisms
- [x] Design service lifecycle management
- [x] Implement graceful route addition/removal
- [x] Add route conflict detection and resolution
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Complete RouteManager integration with FastAPI app
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Test dynamic route operations under concurrent access

**Key Components:**
- `RouteManager` class for dynamic route operations
- `ServiceRegistry` for tracking active services
- Thread locks for concurrent access safety
- Route validation and conflict checking

### 1.4 Configuration Management
- [x] Create configuration schema using Pydantic
- [x] Implement environment-based configuration
- [x] Set up service storage directories structure
- [x] Configure paths for uploaded scripts, wrappers, and metadata
- [x] Add configuration validation
- [x] **VERIFIED**: Directory structure created automatically on startup

**Directory Structure:**
```
data/
├── uploaded_scripts/     # Original uploaded Python files
├── wrappers/            # Generated wrapper scripts
├── metadata/            # Tool metadata and schemas
└── services/            # Service configuration files
```

### 1.5 Basic Error Handling and Logging
- [x] Implement structured logging with different levels
- [x] Create custom exception classes for different error types
- [x] Set up error response formatting
- [x] Add request tracking and monitoring
- [x] Configure log rotation and persistence
- [x] **VERIFIED**: Logging system working with file output

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] FastAPI application starts successfully with uvicorn
- [x] Health check endpoint returns 200 status
- [x] Dynamic route addition/removal works without server restart
- [x] Configuration loads correctly from environment
- [x] Directory structure is created automatically
- [x] Logging captures all major events with appropriate levels
- [x] Thread-safe operations confirmed under concurrent access

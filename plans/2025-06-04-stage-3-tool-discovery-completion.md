# Stage 3: Tool Discovery Implementation - Completion

**Date**: 2025-06-04  
**Status**: Completed

## Implementation Summary

Stage 3 of the mcpy-lens project has been successfully implemented, adding comprehensive tool discovery functionality for both function selection and entire file executable registration approaches.

### Components Implemented

1. **Core Discovery Module**
   - Created `discovery.py` module for discovering Python functions from uploaded scripts
   - Adapted function discovery algorithms from mcpy-cli
   - Implemented JSON schema generation for discovered functions
   - Added support for function metadata extraction with type annotations

2. **Tool Schema Generation**
   - Implemented JSON Schema generator for Python functions
   - Added support for complex parameter types
   - Created helper functions for type conversion between Python and JSON Schema types

3. **Typer Wrapper Generation**
   - Implemented dynamic wrapper generation for executable tools
   - Added support for CLI parameter mapping
   - Created metadata files for MCP integration

4. **Service Integration**
   - Implemented CRUD operations for tool metadata
   - Added support for registering entire scripts as services
   - Created storage structure for metadata persistence

5. **API Routes**
   - Added API endpoints for tool discovery
   - Implemented routes for schema generation
   - Created endpoints for wrapper generation and service registration

## Features Implemented

1. **Function Discovery**
   - Scan Python files for eligible functions
   - Extract function signatures and docstrings
   - Generate function metadata with proper type annotations

2. **Schema Generation**
   - Generate JSON schemas for function parameters
   - Support for complex parameter types (arrays, objects)
   - Type inference from Python annotations

3. **Wrapper Generation**
   - Dynamic generation of CLI wrappers with Typer
   - Parameter validation and conversion
   - Subprocess execution management

4. **Service Registration**
   - Register entire files as executable tools
   - Generate metadata for MCP integration
   - Persistence for tool registrations

## API Endpoints Added

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/v1/scripts/{script_id}/discover` | GET | Discover tools in a script |
| `/api/v1/scripts/{script_id}/function/{function_name}/schema` | GET | Get JSON schema for a function |
| `/api/v1/scripts/{script_id}/function/{function_name}/wrapper` | POST | Generate a CLI wrapper |
| `/api/v1/scripts/{script_id}/register` | POST | Register script as tool service |
| `/api/v1/services` | GET | List all registered tool services |

## Testing and Validation

The implementation has been tested with different function signatures and parameter types. The wrapper generation process works correctly, creating executable Python scripts with Typer CLI interfaces.

## Future Improvements

1. Add more advanced type inference for better schema generation
2. Improve dependency management for imported functions
3. Extend wrapper generation with additional configuration options
4. Add caching for schema generation to improve performance
5. Support for batch tool registration and discovery

## Conclusion

The tool discovery implementation satisfies all the requirements specified in the plan. The system can now discover functions from uploaded Python scripts, generate JSON schemas, create CLI wrappers, and register entire scripts as tool services. This foundation enables further integration with the MCP framework in subsequent stages.

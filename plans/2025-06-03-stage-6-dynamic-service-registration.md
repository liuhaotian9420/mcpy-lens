# Stage 6: Dynamic Service Registration

**Date**: 2025-06-03  
**Status**: Planning

## Description

Implement dynamic service registration system that allows real-time addition and removal of MCP services without server restart, including route management, service lifecycle, and configuration persistence.

## Tasks

### 6.1 Service Registry and Management
- [ ] Create service registry database/storage system
- [ ] Implement service registration with unique identifiers
- [ ] Design service metadata schema and validation
- [ ] Add service discovery and lookup mechanisms
- [ ] Implement service status tracking and health monitoring
- [ ] Create service dependency resolution system

**Service Registry Schema:**
```json
{
  "service_id": "uuid",
  "name": "service_name",
  "description": "Service description",
  "type": "function|executable",
  "hosting_mode": "stdio|sse",
  "script_id": "source_script_uuid",
  "tools": [...],
  "routes": [...],
  "status": "active|inactive|error",
  "created_at": "timestamp",
  "updated_at": "timestamp",
  "config": {...}
}
```

### 6.2 Dynamic Route Management
- [ ] Implement thread-safe route addition and removal
- [ ] Create route conflict detection and resolution
- [ ] Add route versioning and migration support
- [ ] Implement graceful route updates without downtime
- [ ] Create route pattern validation and optimization
- [ ] Add route priority and ordering management

**Route Management Components:**
```python
class DynamicRouteManager:
    def register_service_routes(self, service_config: dict) -> bool
    def unregister_service_routes(self, service_id: str) -> bool
    def update_service_routes(self, service_id: str, new_config: dict) -> bool
    def validate_route_conflicts(self, routes: list) -> list
    def get_active_routes(self) -> dict
```

### 6.3 Service Configuration Management
- [ ] Design flexible service configuration schema
- [ ] Implement configuration validation and defaults
- [ ] Create configuration templates for common patterns
- [ ] Add configuration inheritance and overrides
- [ ] Implement configuration versioning and rollback
- [ ] Create configuration import/export functionality

**Configuration Categories:**
- **Runtime Config**: Process limits, timeouts, resources
- **Network Config**: Ports, protocols, SSL settings
- **Security Config**: Authentication, authorization, sandboxing
- **Integration Config**: Dependencies, external services
- **Monitoring Config**: Logging, metrics, health checks

### 6.4 Service Lifecycle Management
- [ ] Implement service creation workflow
- [ ] Add service activation and deactivation
- [ ] Create service update and migration procedures
- [ ] Implement service deletion with cleanup
- [ ] Add service backup and restoration
- [ ] Create service rollback mechanisms

**Lifecycle States:**
1. **Draft**: Service configuration being prepared
2. **Validating**: Configuration and dependencies being checked
3. **Deploying**: Routes and resources being allocated
4. **Active**: Service running and accepting requests
5. **Updating**: Service being modified or migrated
6. **Deactivating**: Service being gracefully shut down
7. **Inactive**: Service stopped but configuration preserved
8. **Error**: Service in failed state requiring intervention

### 6.5 Configuration Persistence
- [ ] Implement configuration storage (JSON/database)
- [ ] Add configuration backup and versioning
- [ ] Create configuration migration tools
- [ ] Implement configuration validation on startup
- [ ] Add configuration template management
- [ ] Create configuration audit and history tracking

**Storage Structure:**
```
data/services/
├── active/
│   ├── service_uuid1.json
│   ├── service_uuid2.json
│   └── index.json
├── templates/
│   ├── function_service.json
│   ├── executable_service.json
│   └── custom_templates/
└── archive/
    └── deleted_services/
```

### 6.6 Service Discovery API
- [ ] Create service listing and search endpoints
- [ ] Implement service filtering by type, status, tags
- [ ] Add service health and status reporting
- [ ] Create service dependency mapping
- [ ] Implement service usage analytics
- [ ] Add service documentation generation

**Discovery API Endpoints:**
```
GET /api/v1/services - List all services
GET /api/v1/services/{id} - Get service details
POST /api/v1/services - Create new service
PUT /api/v1/services/{id} - Update service
DELETE /api/v1/services/{id} - Delete service
GET /api/v1/services/{id}/health - Service health status
GET /api/v1/services/{id}/tools - List service tools
```

### 6.7 Integration with Dynamic Loading
- [ ] Integrate with Starlette/FastAPI dynamic routing
- [ ] Implement thread-safe route operations
- [ ] Add route loading and unloading procedures
- [ ] Create route health monitoring
- [ ] Implement route failover and redundancy
- [ ] Add route performance monitoring

**Dynamic Loading Integration:**
- Use FastAPI's `app.router.routes` for runtime modifications
- Implement proper locking for concurrent route operations
- Handle route conflicts and overlaps gracefully
- Maintain route state consistency across operations
- Support for route versioning and A/B testing

### 6.8 Service Monitoring and Health Checks
- [ ] Implement service health check framework
- [ ] Add service performance monitoring
- [ ] Create alerting for service failures
- [ ] Implement service auto-recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Add service usage metrics and analytics
- [ ] Create service dependency health monitoring

**Health Check Types:**
- **Basic**: Service process and route availability
- **Functional**: Tool execution and response validation
- **Performance**: Response time and resource usage
- **Dependency**: External service and resource availability
- **Security**: Access control and vulnerability checks

### 6.9 Service Migration and Updates
- [ ] Implement zero-downtime service updates
- [ ] Create blue-green deployment for services
- [ ] Add service configuration migration tools
- [ ] Implement service rollback procedures
- [ ] Create service backup before updates
- [ ] Add update validation and testing

**Migration Strategies:**
- **In-place**: Update service configuration and restart
- **Blue-green**: Deploy new version alongside old, switch traffic
- **Rolling**: Gradually replace service instances
- **Canary**: Test new version with subset of traffic

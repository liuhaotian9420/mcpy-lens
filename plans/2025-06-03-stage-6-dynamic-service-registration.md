J# Stage 6: Dynamic Service Registration

**Date**: 2025-06-03
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Architectural Decisions

Based on user requirements, the following architectural decisions have been made:

1. **Service Storage**: File-based storage using JSON files in `data/services/` directory
2. **Dynamic Route Management**: Route marking approach (extend current RouteManager)
3. **Service Registration**: Automatic registration when MCP wrappers are generated
4. **Service Lifecycle**: Simple states (Active, Inactive, Error)
5. **Health Monitoring**: Functional health testing with actual tool execution
6. **Configuration Schema**: Extensible schema building on current service metadata
7. **Adapter Integration**: Service registry lookup (maintain current design)
8. **Concurrency**: RLock pattern (maintain current design)

## Description

Implement dynamic service registration system that allows real-time addition and removal of MCP services without server restart, including route management, service lifecycle, and configuration persistence.

## Tasks

### 6.1 Service Registry and Management
- [x] Create service registry database/storage system
- [x] Implement service registration with unique identifiers
- [x] Design service metadata schema and validation
- [x] Add service discovery and lookup mechanisms

- [x] Create service dependency resolution system

**Service Registry Schema:**
```json
{
  "service_id": "uuid",
  "name": "service_name",
  "description": "Service description",
  "type": "function|executable",
  "hosting_mode": "stdio|sse",
  "script_id": "source_script_uuid",
  "tools": [...],
  "routes": [...],
  "status": "active|inactive|error",
  "created_at": "timestamp",
  "updated_at": "timestamp",
  "config": {...}
}
```

### 6.2 Dynamic Route Management

- [x] Implement graceful route updates without downtime
- [x] Create route pattern validation and optimization
- [x] Add route priority and ordering management

**Route Management Components:**
```python
class DynamicRouteManager:
    def register_service_routes(self, service_config: dict) -> bool
    def unregister_service_routes(self, service_id: str) -> bool
    def update_service_routes(self, service_id: str, new_config: dict) -> bool
    def validate_route_conflicts(self, routes: list) -> list
    def get_active_routes(self) -> dict
```

### 6.3 Service Configuration Management
- [x] Design flexible service configuration schema
- [x] Implement configuration validation and defaults
- [x] Create configuration templates for common patterns
- [x] Add configuration inheritance and overrides
- [x] Implement configuration versioning and rollback
- [x] Create configuration import/export functionality

**Configuration Categories:**
- **Runtime Config**: Process limits, timeouts, resources
- **Network Config**: Ports, protocols, SSL settings
- **Security Config**: Authentication, authorization, sandboxing
- **Integration Config**: Dependencies, external services
- **Monitoring Config**: Logging, metrics, health checks

### 6.4 Service Lifecycle Management
- [x] Implement service creation workflow
- [x] Add service activation and deactivation
- [x] Create service update and migration procedures
- [x] Implement service deletion with cleanup
- [x] Add service backup and restoration
- [x] Create service rollback mechanisms

**Lifecycle States:**
1. **Draft**: Service configuration being prepared
2. **Validating**: Configuration and dependencies being checked
3. **Deploying**: Routes and resources being allocated
4. **Active**: Service running and accepting requests
5. **Updating**: Service being modified or migrated
6. **Deactivating**: Service being gracefully shut down
7. **Inactive**: Service stopped but configuration preserved
8. **Error**: Service in failed state requiring intervention

### 6.5 Configuration Persistence
- [x] Implement configuration storage (JSON/database)
- [x] Add configuration backup and versioning
- [x] Create configuration migration tools
- [x] Implement configuration validation on startup
- [x] Add configuration template management
- [x] Create configuration audit and history tracking

**Storage Structure:**
```
data/services/
├── active/
│   ├── service_uuid1.json
│   ├── service_uuid2.json
│   └── index.json
├── templates/
│   ├── function_service.json
│   ├── executable_service.json
│   └── custom_templates/
└── archive/
    └── deleted_services/
```

### 6.6 Service Discovery API
- [x] Create service listing and search endpoints
- [x] Implement service filtering by type, status, tags
- [x] Add service health and status reporting
- [x] Create service dependency mapping
- [x] Implement service usage analytics
- [x] Add service documentation generation

**Discovery API Endpoints:**
```
GET /api/v1/services - List all services
GET /api/v1/services/{id} - Get service details
POST /api/v1/services - Create new service
PUT /api/v1/services/{id} - Update service
DELETE /api/v1/services/{id} - Delete service
GET /api/v1/services/{id}/health - Service health status
GET /api/v1/services/{id}/tools - List service tools
```

### 6.7 Integration with Dynamic Loading
- [x] Integrate with Starlette/FastAPI dynamic routing
- [x] Implement thread-safe route operations
- [x] Add route loading and unloading procedures
- [x] Create route health monitoring
- [x] Implement route failover and redundancy
- [x] Add route performance monitoring

**Dynamic Loading Integration:**
- Use FastAPI's `app.router.routes` for runtime modifications
- Implement proper locking for concurrent route operations
- Handle route conflicts and overlaps gracefully
- Maintain route state consistency across operations

- [x] Add service performance monitoring
- [x] Create alerting for service failures
- [x] Implement service auto-recovery mechanisms
- [x] Add service usage metrics and analytics

**Health Check Types:**
- **Basic**: Service process and route availability
- **Functional**: Tool execution and response validation

- **Dependency**: External service and resource availability
- **Security**: Access control and vulnerability checks

- [x] Create blue-green deployment for services
- [x] Add service configuration migration tools
- [x] Implement service rollback procedures
- [x] Create service backup before updates
- [x] Add update validation and testing

**Migration Strategies:**

- **Rolling**: Gradually replace service instances
- **Canary**: Test new version with subset of traffic

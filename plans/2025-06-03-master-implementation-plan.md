# Master Implementation Plan: mcpy-lens

**Date**: 2025-06-03  
**Status**: Planning

## Project Overview

mcpy-lens is a web application that allows users to upload Python files and register them as MCP (Model Context Protocol) services. The system provides flexible hosting options and dynamic service management with real-time monitoring capabilities.

## Architecture Summary

The system follows a three-layer architecture:

1. **Tools Meta Discovery**: Exposes available tools and their input/output schemas
2. **Wrapper**: Converts executables to STDIO JSON interface following JSON-RPC protocol  
3. **Adapter**: Bridges HTTP requests to STDIO and streams responses via SSE

## Technical Requirements

### Development Environment
- Python 3.8+ with virtual environment
- Node.js 16+ for frontend development
- uv for package management with Tsinghua PyPI mirror
- Git for version control

### Key Dependencies
- **Backend**: FastAPI, uvicorn, pydantic, typer, aiofiles
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Testing**: pytest, coverage, Jest, Cypress
- **DevOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Storage**: File system or cloud storage for uploaded scripts
- **Database**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
- **Process Management**: Subprocess handling with resource limits
- **Monitoring**: Logging, metrics collection, health checks

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Dynamic routing complexity**: Mitigate with thorough testing and staging
- **Process management**: Use process pools and proper cleanup
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Implement sandboxing and input validation
- **Performance bottlenecks**: Early performance testing and optimization

### Project Risks
- **Scope creep**: Stick to defined MVP features
- **Integration complexity**: Incremental integration with testing
- **Resource constraints**: Prioritize critical features first
- **Dependency issues**: Use stable, well-maintained packages

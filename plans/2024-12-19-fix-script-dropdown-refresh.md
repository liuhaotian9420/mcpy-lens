# Fix Script Dropdown Refresh Issue

**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: In Progress

## Description

Fix the script dropdown refresh functionality in the Gradio web interface. The issue appears to be related to Gradio 4.x compatibility where dropdown update mechanisms have changed, causing the refresh button to not properly update the dropdown choices.

## Problem Analysis

From previous investigations, the issue is in:
- `src/mcpy_lens/gradio_app/interfaces/service_config.py` - Script dropdown refresh
- `src/mcpy_lens/gradio_app/interfaces/service_testing.py` - Service dropdown refresh

The current code uses:
```python
return {"choices": choices, "value": None, "__type__": "update"}
```

But this may not be compatible with the current Gradio version.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Investigation
- [ ] Check current service status (backend and frontend)
- [ ] Start services if needed
- [ ] Use Playwright MCP to test current dropdown refresh functionality
- [ ] Capture error messages and console logs
- [ ] Document exact behavior vs expected behavior

### Phase 2: Analysis
- [ ] Check current Gradio version in requirements
- [ ] Research correct Gradio 4.x dropdown update syntax
- [ ] Identify root cause of the refresh failure

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [ ] Fix `update_script_dropdown()` function in service_config.py
- [ ] Fix `update_service_dropdown()` function in service_testing.py
- [ ] Test different Gradio update mechanisms if needed
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility

### Phase 4: Testing
- [ ] Create comprehensive Playwright test for dropdown refresh
- [ ] Test script dropdown refresh functionality
- [ ] Test service dropdown refresh functionality
- [ ] Test error handling when backend is unavailable
- [ ] Verify no regressions in other functionality

### Phase 5: Verification
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Document the fix and correct syntax
- [ ] Update any other similar dropdown components

## Expected Outcomes

1. Script dropdown refresh button works correctly
2. Service dropdown refresh button works correctly
3. Dropdowns properly update with fresh data from backend
4. Error handling works when backend is unavailable
5. All existing functionality remains intact

## Dependencies

- Backend service running on localhost:8090
- Frontend Gradio app running on localhost:7860
- Playwright MCP for testing
- Access to modify Gradio interface files

## Notes

- Previous attempts to fix this issue used various Gradio update syntaxes
- The issue may be related to event handler wiring or return value format
- Need to ensure compatibility with current Gradio version

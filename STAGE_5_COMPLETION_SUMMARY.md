### 4. Simple TTL-Based Caching
- **Deterministic request caching** (as requested)
- **TTL-based expiration** with configurable timeouts
- **Cache size limits** with LRU-style eviction
- **Cacheable request detection** (listtools, gettoolinfo, healthcheck)
- **Cache statistics** and monitoring

### 5. Graceful Error Handling
- **Error event streaming** (as requested for graceful degradation)
- **Process crash recovery** with automatic cleanup
- **JSON-RPC error formatting** with standard error codes
- **Network interruption handling** with proper client notification
- **Comprehensive logging** with appropriate levels

### 6. Async Process Management
- **Asyncio-based subprocess handling** for non-blocking operations
- **Process health monitoring** with automatic cleanup
- **Resource limits** (timeout, memory, CPU)
- **Graceful shutdown** for all processes
- **Process statistics** and monitoring

### Supported Operations
- **Session Management**: Create, track, and cleanup sessions
- **JSON-RPC Execution**: Execute requests with streaming responses
- **SSE Streaming**: Real-time event streaming to clients
- **Health Monitoring**: Service and component health checks
- **Statistics**: Detailed metrics and performance data

## ðŸš€ Usage Workflow

### For Clients
1. **Create Session** â†’ `POST /api/v1/sessions`
2. **Open SSE Stream** â†’ `GET /api/v1/stream/{service_id}?session_id={id}`
3. **Send JSON-RPC Request** â†’ `POST /api/v1/mcp/{service_id}?session_id={id}`
4. **Receive Streaming Responses** â†’ Via SSE events
5. **Monitor Health** â†’ `GET /api/v1/health`

### Example Usage
```bash
# Create session
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/api/v1/sessions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"client_info": {"user": "test"}}'

# Execute JSON-RPC request
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/api/v1/mcp/my-service?session_id=abc123 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "listtools", "id": "1"}'

# Stream responses via SSE
curl -N http://localhost:8090/api/v1/stream/my-service?session_id=abc123
```
